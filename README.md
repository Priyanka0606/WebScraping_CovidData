# Web Scraping Covid Data 

In this project, we extract data from a social website  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries and perform EDA, Data Analysis and Predictions. Worldometer analyzes, validates and aggregates data from thousands of sources in real time and provides global COVID-19 live statistics for a wide audience around the world.

 


Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is an automated process of collecting large data(unstructured) from websites. The user can extract all the data on particular sites or the specific data as per the requirement. The data collected can be stored in a structured format for further analysis.

Using this technique makes it easier to gather information automatically to ensure that what's collected from the dynamically changing websites is synchronized with the time the scraping is done.

In this project, a step by step approach was taken by first inspecting the target url, using requests to download the HTML content and then parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract required data. The required data was converted to a table format and futher analysis was performed.
